SYNTH-4#1 Warning
Shallow depth for a dedicated block RAM  
The instance b1/ram8x4_reg is implemented as block RAM but is better mapped onto distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The depth (3 address bits) is shallow. Please use attribute (* ram_style = "distributed" *)  to instruct Vivado to infer distributed LUT RAM.
